		<h2>Are Titles Hard?</h2>
		<p>author: Jeff et.al. </p><br>
		<p>Do you want to write a book or poem? Do you want your work to be noticed? You may not have thought the title was much of a big deal, but it is. If an editor or publisher is uninterested with your title, they will probably chunk it. Here are a few steps on how to come up with a title that will blow you and your publisher away. </p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Sit down and relax. Put some Baroque music on, such as Vivaldi. Dim the lights, and block out noise. Take a deep breath, and with your pen and paper, or computer notepad, close your eyes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Think of your favourite line in your work. Think of keywords. What words jump out? 
				</li>
				<li>
					What words describe what your work is about? Write down your keywords. Come up with a few of your own. Put keywords together. Or just think of words that mean the same as your keywords. Do it how you want.
				</li>
				<li>
					What is the book about? Is it about one certain character (i.e. Harry Potter)? Is it about crime, action, fantasy, romance? If it is an action book, get creative; name it something like "Killing John", "Bombing the Soul" etc.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>5 Cloud Computing Myths – BUSTED!</h2>
		<p>author: Bob Kelso</p><br>
		<p>Nothing gets business and technology folk fired up like the cloud. Some are ardent in their support of cloud-based systems, while others violently oppose it with all the fervour of the religious zealot. Like philosophy, veganism and the existence of a god, cloud technology is a topic that divides people.
		Yet, despite such steadfast opinions, many consumers are still fuzzy on exactly what the cloud is. A recent Webfusion survey polled 1000 people about the cloud, and revealed that 38% had little to no understanding of the term, and many didn’t realise that they used cloud services every day.
		Even in the business world – where cloud services are really coming into their own – understanding of the cloud isn’t perfect. There’s still a lot of misinformation about the cloud and what it can – and cannot – do. In this article, I get all Mythbusters on the cloud and attempt to dispel some of the most common myths about cloud-based services.
