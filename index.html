		<!-- quote from here: http://www.workflowmax.com/cabbage-tree.aspx-->
		<p>"WorkflowMax provides all of the functionality that you find in much more expensive solutions. It's easy to use and I enjoy working with the team at WorkflowMax.  The system is constantly being enhanced with a bunch of great features being added on a  consistent basis.  Support is instantaneous, however the system is very intuitive and robust so the need to contact support is minimal.  It is a great product, and certainly has helped us grow our business."</p>
